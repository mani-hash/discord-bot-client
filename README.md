####How to run the program

####About this Program

This python program allows you to send messages via your bot to a channel.

A bot token is required to be able to send messages. The program accepts only one bot token at a time. 

A channel ID is required for a bot to be able to chat on the given channel.
The program accepts one default bot token and also one temporary bot token that needs to be entered each time you enter the menu.

Also **note that, the bot must be present in the guild/server of the given channel ID and the bot must be able to interact in the given channel ID**

The interpreter will act as your message console.
